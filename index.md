Welcome, I'm Joshua Bloom, a product leader. 

I'm currently the head of product at [wrap.co](https://wrap.co) where I'm shepherding the company through a transition from a general purpose tool to a business focused platform for customer messaging. 

### Background

Originally trained as a software engineer, I went back to [school](https://massart.edu/) to study Industrial Design, and now bring all of my experience to bear on product management. 

I spent five years at one of the world's best design consultancies, [frog](https://frogdesign.com), a couple of years in corporate life helping make [Samsung's](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/) mobile phones better, and for the last four years I've been busy building product portfolios for a couple of San Francisco area startups [SKULLY](https://www.google.com/search?q=skully) & [wrap](https://wrap.co).
