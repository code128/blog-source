Hello, I'm Joshua Bloom, a product leader. 

I'm currently the Chief Product Officer for [wrap.co](https://wrap.co) where I'm shepherding the company through a transition from a general purpose tool to a business focused platform for customer messaging. 

### Background

Originally trained as a software engineer, I went back to [school](https://massart.edu/) to study Industrial Design, and now bring all of my experience together as a product manager. 

I spent 5 years at one of the world's best design consultancies, [frog](https://frogdesign.com), a couple of years in a giant corporation helping make [Samsung's](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/) mobile phones better, and for the last few years I've been building product portfolios for San Francisco area startups.
