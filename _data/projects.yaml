  name: frog BuildOff!
  story: I created and ran the first day long company wide BuildOff for frog in San Francisco. To help build new relationships across disciplines, I chose teams of designers, technologists, writers and researchers to work together. Each team was given a goal to design and build the <em>most interesting</em> creation. After a tough decision, the judges awarded the medal to "CPR training frog". <br><br>This was such a hit within frog that I was invited to bring the BuildOff globally to our other studios.

  story: Starting with a <a href="http://www.staples.com/Staples-Easy-Button/product_606396">Staples Easy Button</a> I made a replica OctoAlert button for the kids to press while they watch the undersea adventures of the <a href="http://www.octonauts.com/">Octonuats</a>. Pressing the button triggers a small app I have running on the living room computer which sounds the <a href="/sounds/alert.mp3">OctoAlert</a>.

  name: Reverse Soundboard
  story: A fun tool that serves up a web soundboard with a twist when a client clicks on a sound it plays on the serving computer not the client. This is perfect for open plan offices/schools, anywhere you have a bunch of people listening to a common audio system from a computer. <br><br>Bonus points for recording co-workers and playing their voices back for everyone. <em>(warning not all people find this funny)</em>
