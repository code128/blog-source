The Disney Magic Band and Personal Experience Portal was a great and challenging project. 

Disney engaged frog early in this project to help them envision and design the overall experience for Guests and Castmembers. Unfortunately I can't go very deep into this work, but hopefully these images and links give you a flavor of my work.

+ **Role:** Technology & Creative Direction for the experience prototype
+ **Team:** (~14) 5 Design Technologists, 3 Interaction Designers, 4 Visual Designers, 1 Technical Architect, 1 Project Manager
+ **Company:** [frog](https://www.frogdesign.com)
+ **Client:** [Disney](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/)
