The SKULLY HUD was the key visual interface for our riders. It needed to be crisp, non distracting, and present just the right information at the right time. 

+ **Role:** VP Design (player/coach)
+ **Team:** (3) 1 Visual Designer, 1 Firmware Developer
+ **Company:** [SKULLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skully_(helmet))

  <figcaption>The wiki documentation system featured animated movies to help explain the subtle aspects of the desired transitions. If you don't architect for these kinds of things early, the UI can be very hard to retrofit with animations.</figcaption>
