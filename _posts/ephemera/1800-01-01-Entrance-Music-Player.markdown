### Entrance Music Player

You know how when a boxer makes their way to the stage they get their own entrance music. Well this is like that, except that it was for the designers in the Method Studio and it was keyed on each person's badge number. 

The badge security system had a web accessible page that reported the front door opening and listed the badge number so this script scraped it every second and if it saw a new entrance, it would play that person's theme song as their entrance music.
