### A fun tool that serves up a web soundboard with a twist, when a client clicks on a sound it plays on the serving computer not the client.

This is perfect for open plan offices/schools, anywhere you have a bunch of people listening to a common audio system from a computer.

Also extra fun points for recording co-workers and playing their voices back for everyone.
